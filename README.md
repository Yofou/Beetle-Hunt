# Beetle-Hunt

Have two players. The youngest player rolls the dice first, then play continues clockwise. Players throw the dice in turn and draw body parts of the beetle depending on the dice they have thrown.

• There are 14 body parts to draw: a body, a head, six legs, two wings, two antennae and two eyes

• You must throw a six to start – to draw the body

• Throw a five – draw the head • Throw a four – draw the wings

• Throw a three – draw a leg • Throw a two – draw an antennae

• Throw a one – draw an eye

You must collect a the body before anything else, so you can’t start until you throw a six. You must collect a head (five) before you can collect the eyes and antennae.

The first player to draw a complete beetle shouts ‘BEETLE’ and scores the maximum 14 points for that round. Everyone else counts up how many body parts they have drawn, and scores one point per body part.

In the event of a tie, the two players with the same number of points rolls a dice and the one with the highest throw becomes the overall winner. At the end of the beetle drive, the winner is the person who has accrued the most points across all the games played.
